# Hotel-Cancellation-Analysis
This GitHub repository hosts a comprehensive Python and Data Science project that delves into the analysis of hotel booking data to discern the key factors influencing cancellation rates. The project employs various techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn, Feature Engineering, and Predictive Modeling using the Decision Tree Classifier.

The primary objective is to provide valuable insights and recommendations aimed at reducing cancellations, optimizing pricing strategies, and ultimately enhancing revenue generation for both City Hotel and Resort Hotel.

## Techniques Used
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Uncover data patterns, trends, and relationships.

### Data Cleaning: 
Handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns, and transform data types.

### Data Visualization: 
Utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical representation.

### Feature Engineering: 
Create new relevant features for analysis and modeling.

### Predictive Modeling: 
Employ the Decision Tree Classifier to predict cancellation probability.

### Model Evaluation:
Assess the performance and accuracy of the predictive model.
Findings

### Cancellation Rate:
City Hotel exhibits a higher cancellation rate than Resort Hotel.

### Booking Trend: 
Bookings show an overall increase over the years, with notable peaks in specific months.

### Guest Origins: 
The majority of guests originate from specific countries.

### Accommodation Type: 
Couples and families are the most booked accommodation types.

### Stay Duration: 
Most guests stay for short durations of 1-4 nights.

## Recommendations
Implement strategies to reduce cancellations by analyzing pricing and promotional decisions.
Focus on peak booking months and adjust hotel operations accordingly.
Target marketing efforts towards countries with high guest origins.
Optimize room allocations and types based on booking trends and stay durations.
By following these recommendations, hotels can not only minimize cancellations but also optimize revenue generation and provide enhanced guest experiences.
